# ATMinterface1
This is a simple Java program that simulates the working of an ATM machine. 
It allows the user to perform basic banking operations through a menu-driven interface:
Withdraw money (only if sufficient balance is available)
Deposit money (only valid positive amounts)
Check account balance
Exit the system
The project uses two classes:
BankAccount → Stores and updates the account balance.
ATM → Provides menu options (withdraw, deposit, check balance) and connects with the bank account
